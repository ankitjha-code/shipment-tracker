## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Design Choices

* **Java 21 & Spring Boot 3.3.2**: Modern, robust foundation for building REST APIs.
* **Maven**: For dependency management.
* **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns into Controller, Service, and Repository layers.
* **In-Memory Storage**: Uses a thread-safe `ConcurrentHashMap` for data storage as required.
* **DTO Pattern**: Decouples the API contract from the internal domain model for better stability and security.
* **Centralized Exception Handling**: Provides consistent and clean error responses using `@ControllerAdvice`.
* **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Integrated for live, interactive API documentation.
* **JUnit 5 & Mockito**: For unit testing critical business logic to ensure correctness.
